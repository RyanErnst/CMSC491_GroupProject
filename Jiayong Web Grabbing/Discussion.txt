It's a tablet device marketed as a hybrid (that, by all reports, chugs like hell when forced into 1080p mode through the dock) powered by a Tegra chip derived from Nvidia's efforts to provide graphics for phones and tablets.

		It's a tablet device marketed as a hybrid (that, by all reports, chugs like hell when forced into 1080p mode through the dock) powered by a Tegra chip derived from Nvidia's efforts to provide graphics for phones and tablets.
Given that the vast majority of games out today aren't that graphically demanding, this is not that big a deal.
=============================My predictions:
1st Year: We'll mostly see lots of ports, including the tablet-only games that can't be used in TV mode.
^ I saw a video about that yesterday and you know what, it makes me want to lick a cartridge now

		I thought Nintendo said they weren't going to do this?
Now, this particular game is rhythm game Voez:

The curious thing is that Nintendo really hasn't talked much about the touchscreen, and it's probably to avoid controversy of such titles making their way over to it.
=============================The 3DS had (and still has) strong third party support.

I thought they were well-known for generating buzz via scarcity.
=============================Maybe use the savings for a pro controller.
But if your DS/3DS goes kaput, as long as the card is intact you're fine.
At a minimum, they should supplement it with cloud saves or something.
=============================It just feels like they pushed the Switch out the door, half done.Click to expand...
If that doesn't live up to standards, it might be the final coffin nail for the Switch.

Not a single one of that neckbearded turbonerd's videos are worth watching.
It's an odd contrast to the poor workings of the dock.
Still, Boogie's generally a great youtuber, even if I find that video pretty weak.
=============================I'm gonna be part of the Splatoon 2 Global Testfire next weekend.
If it was to be the 3DS successor, then they should have just done that and had a very slightly smaller version with 3DS port and maybe the two detachable controllers that resembled the New 3DS control layout each.
I love the WiiU, but the userbase just wasn't there, and it was clear it would never get it.
=============================I was merely responding to Timby's amusing comment about "a Tegra pushing 60fps at 1080p" when it's already been demonstrated to be able to do just that.
Launch the system when you have the games and the issues worked out, more so when your last system only failed because of no press or ads and even fewer games.
I don't even consider the motion controls a gimmick, it's just not needed as much as Nintendo has shown it off.

		Afraid of scratches?
What weve learned today may clarify the situation.
Those will fit in the card slot, greatly expanding it's storage.
=============================Players who purchase a physical copy of LEGO City Undercover on Nintendo Switch at retail are getting the complete game, and do not need to download additional content to enjoy the full experience.
The only internet connection suggested is to download the typical content update patch."
If we are to take the Joy-Con and dock prices seriously, the portable unit itself is worth $130!

Trade them in at GameStop and you'd get a cool $20.

Yep, it was brought up during the launch info in January.
Yeah, the only way $90 would be worth it is if they were deluxe units with many improvements to them, like higher quality plastic and felt or brush lining and special branded theming.
