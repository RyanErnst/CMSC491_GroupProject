With the Joy-Cons attached, it feels like a slightly lighter, smaller version of the standard Xbox controller.
I often found myself in the middle of a quest in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when a favorite show was coming on, so I simply attached the Joy-Cons and played on the couch while half-watching TV.

=============================Joy-Con layout is cramped and crowded, and the left one can have connection issues when wireless.The Bottom Line The Nintendo Switch is a solid piece of hardware that delivers an impressive gameplay experience in a small chassis.
The Nintendo Switch is a much more elegantly designed console from top to bottom, light-years ahead of the plastic goofiness of its spiritual predecessor, the GamePad on 2012's  	 	Wii U.

=============================All sorts of variables, such as the intensity of the section of the game youre playing, could impact that result.The second test, which is more typical of how most people will use the console on the go, is encouraging.
Extra Joy-Con controllers can cost 75 a piece, and even a new AC adapter can set you back 25.There are also some accessories that many will consider necessities.
Maybe its a brand new Nintendo IP...no...that would never happen.
=============================This is the first time Nintendo has put online multiplayer behind a paywall, and it puts the Switch in line with the PS4 and the Xbox One.Even if you accept that online multiplayer is something that you should pay a fee for (which it isnt  online multiplayer works just fine without any extra fees on PC), theres no proof that Nintendo knows how to craft an online service worth paying for.
Definitely got some Sonic 06 vibes from that one.Despite my complaints, Im still very excited for the Switch.
The Wii U was a disaster for Nintendo, and with its strategy for the Switch, we see that its learned something from that.
=============================Detaching the Joy-Cons can be a little fiddly, but is essentially done by holding a small button on their backs and sliding the controller up.
The grip provides just enough extra plastic to make the controllers much more comfortable in the hands, and having the console a little further away from you means that your sitting posture feels a lot more natural.
But there are a couple of issues that prevent the console from fully capitalising on tabletop mode.
=============================It features a 6.2-inch capacitive touch-screen with an HD resolution (1280720).
We also dont know whether data can be transferred via the USB-C port or not.
The right controller, interestingly, houses a depth-sensing infra-red (IR) camera.Nintendo says that the camera can sense the distance between the controller and an object and that it can detect shapes.
=============================Nintendo said that it planned to make two million systems available worldwide this month  but if my fun experience with it is any indication, it might be hard to find one left on store shelves.AdvertisementOn Engadget, Devindra Hardawar said the lack of full testing didnt inspire confidence.Clearly, Nintendo was in a bit of a rush to launch the Switch.
But for now, its too early to tell.As incredibly versatile as the Switchs hardware and technical capabilities are, the console feels incomplete at launch without a strong lineup of games, access to Nintendos rich back catalog of iconic titles and really any online services to speak of.
I can do both!
